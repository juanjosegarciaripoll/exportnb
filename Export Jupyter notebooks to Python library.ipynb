    "The following code takes a bunch of Jupyter notebooks and extracts code cells building a library out of them. The goal is to have a tool that allows us to write all Python code in the form of Jupyter notebooks, so as to better document their development, underlying algorithms and even sample applications, and then build useful (and compact) libraries out of those self-documented files.\n",

    "The logic of the program is as follows. It takes a bunch of Jupyter notebook file names and reads all of those notebooks, one after another. For each cell, it looks for the first line to find whether it contains the line `# file: xxxxx`, where `xxxxx` can be any valid file name. If so, it adds the cell to the code that is to be exported into the file with that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some remarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* File names may contain directory names. By default, those directories will be built by the exporting routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple cells can be written to the same Python file. They are written in the order in which they appear, which is the usual one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, a single Jupyter notebook can contain code for multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the file name contains spaces, use enclose it in double-quotes, as in `# file: \"my long file name.py\"`. I am not sure this is useful, though, as `import` statements do not allow spaces in file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By default, the code inserts empty newlines between cells. This avoids frequent errors that originate from different indentations in different cells, functions being joined, etc."
